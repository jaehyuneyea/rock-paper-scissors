# rock-paper-scissors
<p>In this project I will be using vanilla JavaScript to create a game that challenges the game in a classic game of rock paper scissors. For now, the game will be done purely in the console, however I will come back to it later to add GUI elements.</p>

<p>3/8/2022: Finished the console functionality of the game! The game is played to be 5 rounds- where the user is prompted to choose rock paper or scissors. Any input other than that prompts the user to choose a proper value. The CPU will then select its choice and compare it to see who the winner is. A series of if statements, switch statements were used to create the structure of this game.</p>
